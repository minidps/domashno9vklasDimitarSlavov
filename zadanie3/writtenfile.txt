Until the age of 16, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In 335 BC, shortly after his
assumption of kingship over Macedon, he campaigned in the Balkans and reasserted
control over Thrace and parts of Illyria before marching on the city of Thebes, which
was subsequently destroyed in battle. Alexander then led the League of Corinth, and
used his authority to launch the pan-Hellenic project envisaged by his father, assuming
leadership over all Greeks in their conquest of Persia.
